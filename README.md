<h1 >Web App for Job Referral</h1> 

The web app for job referral is a comprehensive platform that serves as a centralized hub for job referrals, resume analysis using AI, and ranking students based on their resume scores. It aims to provide an excellent platform for individuals to discover and seize job opportunities. The key features of the project include Google Sign-In for authentication, Next.js for enhanced efficiency, Firestore database for real-time updates, and two user modes: hirer and student.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>

1. *Job Referrals*: The web app allows users to create job referral listings, where hirers can post job opportunities and students can discover these listings.

2. *Resume Analysis using AI*: The platform utilizes AI technologies to analyze resumes and assign them a score based on various factors like skills, education, experience, and achievements. This score serves as an indicator of the candidate's suitability for the job.

3. *Resume Ranking*: The system ranks students based on their resume scores. This feature enables hirers to quickly identify top candidates and students to assess their competitiveness in the job market.

4. *Google Sign-In*: The web app integrates Google Sign-In as an authentication mechanism. Users can sign in securely using their Google accounts, ensuring a streamlined and hassle-free login experience.

5. *Next.js for Efficiency*: The project utilizes Next.js, a popular React framework, known for its performance optimization and server-side rendering capabilities. Next.js enhances the overall efficiency and user experience of the web app.

6. *Firestore Database*: Firestore, a NoSQL document database provided by Firebase, is utilized for real-time data storage and retrieval. It offers seamless integration with Next.js and allows for instant updates and data synchronization across multiple users and devices.

7. *Two User Modes*: The web app caters to two primary user modes: hirer and student. Hirers can create job listings, browse resumes, and contact potential candidates. Students, on the other hand, can create their profiles, submit resumes, and explore job opportunities posted by hirers.

By combining these features, the web app for job referral provides a powerful platform that connects hirers with suitable candidates and offers students a chance to showcase their skills and abilities to potential employers. The utilization of AI for resume analysis and ranking enhances the efficiency of the hiring process, making it easier for hirers to identify top talent.

Overall, the web app for job referral aims to streamline the job search and hiring process by leveraging AI, real-time updates, and user-friendly features, ultimately bridging the gap between job seekers and employers in a more effective and efficient manner.

## Setting up Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
